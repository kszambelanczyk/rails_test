<p begin="00:00:08.759" end="00:00:13.839">causes the tailbone to be<br />stuck in a side vent position.</p>
<p begin="00:00:15.349" end="00:00:22.079">On each side of the tailbone which<br />is at the bottom of the sacrum.</p>
<p begin="00:00:22.859" end="00:00:24.250"></p>
<p begin="00:00:26.420" end="00:00:30.550">The tailbone is found and it's<br />comprised of four</p>
<p begin="00:00:30.710" end="00:00:33.009"></p>
<p begin="00:00:33.240" end="00:00:37.359">They will fuse together but retained<br />some Mobility where they connect with</p>
<p begin="00:00:37.359" end="00:00:43.369">the sacrum and a traumatic injury<br />such as a fall on onto your sit bones</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.899" end="00:00:49.689">falling on one side may cause it to<br />get stuck in a bent position bent to</p>
<p begin="00:00:49.689" end="00:00:58.750">one side and that happens you can<br />find that if you palpate with your</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.750" end="00:01:02.649">fingertips on both sides, you'll<br />notice that unwinds the one side</p>
<p begin="00:01:02.649" end="00:01:09.650">there's a deeper sulcus and that is<br />if its side bent to the right then</p>
<p begin="00:01:09.989" end="00:01:11.269"></p>
<p begin="00:01:12.409" end="00:01:17.310">On this transverse process early,<br />where's on the other side?</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.310" end="00:01:25.150">There's a deeper a wider Feltes and<br />one would think that if one has an</p>
<p begin="00:01:25.150" end="00:01:29.769">injury and it causes that tailbone to<br />be bent to one side one would think</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.840" end="00:01:34.459">that treatment would involve directly<br />pushing it back in the direction</p>
<p begin="00:01:34.459" end="00:01:39.200">where it belongs and that is at times<br />true.</p>
<p begin="00:01:39.799" end="00:01:43.469">But other times if the injury<br />involves the whole pelvis and</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.469" end="00:01:48.219">there's a whole twisting mechanism that<br />occurs throughout the hip joints and</p>
<p begin="00:01:48.219" end="00:01:53.489">the sacroiliac joints involving a<br />whole pelvis than these large</p>
<p begin="00:01:53.489" end="00:02:01.430">ligaments that connect the pelvic<br />bones to the sacrum and coccyx as</p>
<p begin="00:02:01.430" end="00:02:06.640">well those become involved and it<br />because it becomes very difficult</p>
<p begin="00:02:08.819" end="00:02:15.900">large forces that are maintaining the<br />The tailbone in a side vent position</p>
<p begin="00:02:16.349" end="00:02:20.340">and a nose examples, you have to<br />treat that twisting pattern</p>
<p begin="00:02:20.379" end="00:02:21.580"></p>
<p begin="00:02:22.229" end="00:02:26.949">There's a pattern that I've<br />discovered and described and develops</p>
<p begin="00:02:26.949" end="00:02:29.219"></p>
<p begin="00:02:30.659" end="00:02:35.599">Windswept pelvis and that's a pattern<br />in which your five different things</p>
<p begin="00:02:35.599" end="00:02:40.789">that you need to do to create balance<br />in the hips and the sit bones in the</p>
<p begin="00:02:40.789" end="00:02:47.729">sacroiliac joints prior to reducing<br />the side vent fixation of the coccyx.</p>
<p begin="00:02:48.539" end="00:02:55.090">So I think that that's serves as a<br />nice introduction into the type of</p>
<p begin="00:02:55.110" end="00:03:02.210">tailbone injury that is named side<br />vent fixation and there are other</p>
<p begin="00:03:02.210" end="00:03:07.240">types of injuries such as a backward<br />bent coccyx that the delivery of a</p>
<p begin="00:03:07.719" end="00:03:15.780">large baby and fall on the tailbone<br />can cause it to flex forward and</p>
<p begin="00:03:16.139" end="00:03:22.229">sometimes one of these statements<br />will separate and that can be named a</p>
<p begin="00:03:22.259" end="00:03:27.020">fractured coccyx when in fact, it's<br />actually a separation of a joint.</p>
<p begin="00:03:27.849" end="00:03:30.009">But another left that's what they<br />call it.</p>
<p begin="00:03:30.580" end="00:03:33.879">So this concludes my discussion and<br />there's a couple of</p>
<p begin="00:03:33.879" end="00:03:35.449"></p>
<p begin="00:03:35.500" end="00:03:42.770">I posted on the subject of coccyx<br />pain coccyx joint dysfunction and</p>
<p begin="00:03:42.939" end="00:03:48.319">also on the pattern which I<br />named lower Windswept pelvis.</p>
