00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:08.760
This is a brief video on a type of
a toxic sore tailbone injury that

2
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.840
causes the tailbone to be
stuck in a side vent position.

3
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:22.080
On each side of the tailbone which
is at the bottom of the sacrum.

4
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.250
These are the two sit Bones.

5
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.550
The tailbone is found and it's
comprised of four

6
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.010
bones and quite often.

7
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.360
They will fuse together but retained
some Mobility where they connect with

8
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.370
the sacrum and a traumatic injury
such as a fall on onto your sit bones

9
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.690
falling on one side may cause it to
get stuck in a bent position bent to

10
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:58.750
one side and that happens you can
find that if you palpate with your

11
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.650
fingertips on both sides, you'll
notice that unwinds the one side

12
00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:09.650
there's a deeper sulcus and that is
if its side bent to the right then

13
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.270
you will hit.

14
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.310
On this transverse process early,
where's on the other side?

15
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:25.150
There's a deeper a wider Feltes and
one would think that if one has an

16
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.770
injury and it causes that tailbone to
be bent to one side one would think

17
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.460
that treatment would involve directly
pushing it back in the direction

18
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.200
where it belongs and that is at times
true.

19
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.470
But other times if the injury
involves the whole pelvis and

20
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.220
there's a whole twisting mechanism that
occurs throughout the hip joints and

21
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.490
the sacroiliac joints involving a
whole pelvis than these large

22
00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:01.430
ligaments that connect the pelvic
bones to the sacrum and coccyx as

23
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.640
well those become involved and it
because it becomes very difficult

24
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:15.900
large forces that are maintaining the
The tailbone in a side vent position

25
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.340
and a nose examples, you have to
treat that twisting pattern

26
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.580
throughout the whole pelvis.

27
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.950
There's a pattern that I've
discovered and described and develops

28
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.220
even for an installed lower.

29
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.600
Windswept pelvis and that's a pattern
in which your five different things

30
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.790
that you need to do to create balance
in the hips and the sit bones in the

31
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:47.730
sacroiliac joints prior to reducing
the side vent fixation of the coccyx.

32
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:55.090
So I think that that's serves as a
nice introduction into the type of

33
00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:02.210
tailbone injury that is named side
vent fixation and there are other

34
00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:07.240
types of injuries such as a backward
bent coccyx that the delivery of a

35
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:15.780
large baby and fall on the tailbone
can cause it to flex forward and

36
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:22.230
sometimes one of these statements
will separate and that can be named a

37
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.020
fractured coccyx when in fact, it's
actually a separation of a joint.

38
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.010
But another left that's what they
call it.

39
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.880
So this concludes my discussion and
there's a couple of

40
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.450
other YouTube videos.

41
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:42.770
I posted on the subject of coccyx
pain coccyx joint dysfunction and

42
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.320
also on the pattern which I
named lower Windswept pelvis.

43
00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:49.530
Thank you very much.
